# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Lux. It's people like you that make Free and Open Source apps so great. No big commitment required. If all you do is review a single Pull Request, you are a maintainer. And a hero.

There are many ways to contribute from translation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Lux itself.

## Getting Started

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
